# Simple Akinator Game in Python

This is a beginner-friendly Python project inspired by the Akinator game.  
The program asks the user a series of questions and tries to guess the character they are thinking of.

## Dataset
The game uses a dataset stored in `Akinator_Dataset.csv`.  
- Make sure this file is in the same folder as `simpleAkinator.py`.  
- If you clone this repository, the dataset will be included automatically.  
- If you download manually, place the CSV in the same directory as the Python file.

## Features
- Interactive text-based guessing game
- Characters are chosen from the list shown at the start
- Type **`stop`** at any time to exit the game
- Uses conditional logic and loops
- Easy to extend with more characters/questions by editing the dataset

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files (`simpleAkinator.py` and `Akinator_Dataset.csv`).
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   py simpleAkinator.py
